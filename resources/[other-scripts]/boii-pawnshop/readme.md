# BOII | DEVELOPMENT - ACTIVITY: PAWNSHOP 

Here we have a nice clean pawnshop script for your citizens to make some quick cash!
Script comes pre setup with 3 stores, pawnshop, techshop and a fence to sell items.
Each ped location includes a built in store to sell whatever items you require.
Script includes a config option to enable a SQL based buyback system, allowing citizens to purchase back items sold by other citizens.
Enjoy :)

### INSTALL

1) Edit `shared/config.lua` and `shared/language.lua` to your requirements
2) Drag and drop `boii-pawnshop` into your server resources
3) Add `ensure boii-pawnshop` into your `server.cfg` ensuring load order is correct
4) If you wish to use the buyback system you must add the `sql.sql` provided into your server database
5) Open f8 and type `refresh; ensure boii-pawnshop` or restart your server to start the script
